### Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹
I have a background in both music composition and theory where I have learned to connect creativity with abstract thinking. Now, as a frontend developer,  I am excited to combine all of these skills to write elegant, meaningful code. 

- ðŸŽ“  Frontend Web Developer grad from Flatiron School.
- ðŸ˜µ  I am excited about JavaScript, Node.js, React, Redux, and HTML/CSS frameworks such as Handlebars and Bootstrap. 
- ðŸ”­  Working on a React chatbot to serve resources dedicated to mental health and therapy. 
- ðŸŒ±  Learning TypeScript! 
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me anythig about music!
- ðŸ“«  Find me on my <a href="www.ryanmanchester.info"/>portfolio site</a>.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I still write and record music. Find me on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Ov5QA5DAgkXHQLMKyVSJe?si=EDU1fqX-TU2YZH9N-m36dg">Spotify</a>
