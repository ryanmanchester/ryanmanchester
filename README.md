- ðŸ˜µ  I am excited about Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, and Redux.
- ðŸ”­  Working on an e-commerce web app featuring a Rails API backend and React/Redux frontend. 
- ðŸŒ±  Learning about Node.js API requests 
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me anythig about music!
- ðŸ“«  Find me on my <a href="www.ryanmanchester.info"/>portfolio site</a>.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I still write and record music. Find me on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Ov5QA5DAgkXHQLMKyVSJe?si=EDU1fqX-TU2YZH9N-m36dg">Spotify</a>
