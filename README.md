### Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

**ryanmanchester/ryanmanchester** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I have a background in music, both composition and theory where I have learned how to connect creativity with abstract thinking. Now, as a full stack developer,  I am excited to combine all of these skills to write elegant, meaningful code. 

- ðŸ˜µ I am excited about Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, and Redux.
- ðŸ”­ Working on an e-commerce web app featuring a Rails API backend and React/Redux frontend. 
- ðŸŒ± Learning about Redux state management. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with job search post graduation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anythig about music!
- ðŸ“« Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-manchester-6537a630"/>LinkdIn</a>
